Outside his theater one night, Flynn meets a young boy who just might save the day. Inside a small box the boy shows Flynn his pride and joy: a caterpillar named Curly that dances to \"Yes Sir, That's My Baby.\" Word quickly spreads about the amazingly talented hoofer, and the caterpillar becomes a symbol of hope for wartime America. Soon, offers are pouring in to capitalize on this sensational insect. Will Curly go Hollywood or will Flynn's get-rich-quicker quick scheme go to the bugs? Once Upon a Time is a furry fairy tale that's fun for the whole family.",
